    <H2>Ingredients</H2>

    <h4> Cheese filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li> 1 large egg</li>
            <li> 2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li> 3/4 cups Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h4> Meat Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li> 1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li> 3/4 pound ground beef</li>
            <li> 3/4 pound ground italian sausage</li>
            <li> 3 cloves garlic </li>
            <li> 1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li> 40 ounces marinara sauce</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>

    <h4> Lasagna</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li> 2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients. </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a 
                little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.) </li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and 
                crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease. </li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, 
                hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently. </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°. </li>
            <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al 
                dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you do not overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout 
                cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.
            </li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna. </li>
            <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed. </li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce. </li>
            <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese. </li>
            <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it. </li>
            <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.
            </li>
